## Why
- **Decentralized**: No centralized management, free from cencorship
- **Immutable**: Data on the chain exist forever, extremely hard to manipulate
- **Transparent**: Public to everyone

---

## What
- State machine

### Core
- Atomic events are called **Transactions**
- Tansactions are wrapped into a **Block**
- The process of wrapping a block is called **Mining**

---

### P2P network
- Blocks are broadcasted to the network
- Blocks are collected and verified by each p2p node
- Blocks are appended to the **Chain**, thus the name **Blockchain**

---

### Consensus
- Chain from different nodes have different blocks, sometimes they fork
- The status when each chain has the same blocks is called **Consensus**
- There are different algorithms to achieve consensus. ex: PBFT / PoW / PoS

---

## Applications
- Bitcoin (Value transfering)
- Ethereum (Smart contract)
- Iota (Internet of things)
...

---

## How
- Begin from Ethereum

### 3R: Read, Realize, Reproduce
1. Read white paper
2. Realize source code
3. Reproduce similar funcionality

## [Simblock](https://github.com/juinc/simblock)
- Simple Blockchain Implementation
- Current status: only the core part is developed
- Need more contributors
