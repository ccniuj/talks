# What is Ethereum (1)?
## A platform that runs decentralized applications

---
# What is Ethereum (2)?
## Difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum
- State Modeling (UTXO v.s. World State)
- Rewarding Mechanism (uncle blocks are introduced)
- Turing Complete Programmability (smart contract)

# How Does Smart Contract Work (2)?
## Ethereum Virtual Machine
- A machine that performs instructions from compiled bytecode (smart contract) which is stored in world state
- Quasi-Turing-Complete Machine, will raise out-of-gas(oos) exception if the paid gas is insufficient

---
## Application of Smart Contract: EtherDelta (1)
### 2 types of contracts
- ERC20 Token Contract
- Exchange Contract

## Application of Smart Contract: EtherDelta (2)
### ERC20 Token
- ERC: Ethereum Request for Comments
- Spec of interface that token contract has to implement
- Interface including:
  - totalSupply
  - balanceOf
  - trasfer
  - transferFrom
  - approve
  - allowance

# Conclusion
### 1. Smart contract makes ethereum powerful
### 2. Join us!
- For developers
**Join our meetups and give us a talk**

- For non-developers
**Write some articles on trending or case study**
