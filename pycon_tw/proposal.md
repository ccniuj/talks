# The Power of Decentralization: Take ZeroNet for Example

## Abstract
The Web is centralized nowadays-- i.e. we need to access to a specific domain, whose server is connecting to a giant database, in order to utilize specific services, such as Google, Facebook, ApplePay, etc. This could potentially be a problem since it is susceptible to monitoring and censoring. In this short talk, I would like to introduce **decentralized web** via demonstrating **ZeroNet** and explaining how it works under the hood.

## Outline
- What is **decentralization**?
- How does **ZeroNet** work?
- Pros and Cons
- Demo: decentralized chatroom

## Target Audience
- Who has intermediate Python skills
- Who has experiences in web developing

## How-to
- Slides
- Live demo

## Reference
