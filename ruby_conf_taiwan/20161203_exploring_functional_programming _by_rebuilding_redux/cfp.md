## Title 
#### Exploring Functional Programming by Rebuilding Redux

## Abstract

The goal of this talk is to introduce basic functional programming concepts. This will be achieved by demonstrating how to rebuild [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), a popular Javascript library, using Ruby. For this purpose, I open-sourced a gem called [Rubidux](https://github.com/davidjuin0519/rubidux), which borrows the model from Redux.

## Outline

1. #### What is functional programming (FP)?

  Functional programming is a paradigm of programming.

  Some features are:
  - Describe **what you want** rather than **how you do it**
  - Functions are first-class
  - Higher order functions => map, reduce, filter, compose, curry
  - Lexical closure
  - Referential transparency => pure function
  - Pattern matching
  - Lazy evaluation
  - No side-effects
  - Immutable data

2. #### Why is FP getting popular again?

  - Greater computing power compared to 50 years ago
  - Need for high concurrency application (immutability)
  - Big data (data pipeline infrastructures like Hadoop / Spark)
  
  ##### Can Ruby do functional programming?

  - Ruby is an elegant language
  - Ruby is inspired by LISP
  - Ruby has lambda

  So, yes, Ruby can do FP, technically.

3. #### Introduction to Redux

  Redux is a great choice to get going.

  - Use a lot of FP concepts
  - Tiny
  - Well documented
  - Increasingly used in Javascript apps

4. #### Demonstrating Rubidux

  Including FP concepts and skills such as:
  - Lambda
  - Compose
  - Curry
  - Map / Reduce
  - Lazy evaluation

5. #### Possible use case of Rubidux

  Providing state management for [Reactrb](https://github.com/reactrb/reactrb) (Ruby wrapper for React.js)

6. #### Takeaway messages 

  - Have a sense of using Ruby lambda
  - Know how to complement OO design with FP style
  - Contribute to Rubidux if you like it

## Pitch
